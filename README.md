# If you are here, you are a Valve End-User who wants to see Valve do better.

# If you are a User who has spent money on Steam, you are Valve's Investor Funding.

# If you are an employee for Valve, or your company is Affiliated with Valve, you may have had problems related to Valve, whether on or off premesis.

If you are Valve, you see yourself as not responsible for the angry feedback from the above groups.  If you are Valve, you get 300000 signatures and throw them out.  If you are Valve, you have allegations come out alledging in-office abuse, gatekeeping, and near-crunch time schedules, and your opinion is that any new employee needs to prove themselves in order to become "True Valve", despite experience in the industry.

In all of this, If you are Valve in any of this situation, you believe it isn't a problem, and people need to simply shut up, buy more lootboxes, play around the bots, and deal with it.

The problem is, If you are Valve, this is an awful position to be in.

### Evidence?  Lookup Activion's Buyout in 1998.

While Valve has a large, large market in PC gaming, there is a problem.  

A new game is released, instantly has high rank botting, making anything other than pub stomps impossible for good players.  At times, solely Pro Players.

Recently, a Public Display of a cheat engine was used to invade a Tournament Match of Apex Legends, a game famously known for being based on the source engine.

E-Sports teams that used to be the center focus of discussion at the Dota International are being bought up by foreign investment.

And, that exact Foreign Investment might be able to purchase Valve in the same way Activision was purchased when they hit a few missteps.  I for one would love to see my Steam account hit the 30 year mark, and I would like to be able to login and Speedrun Fable 1 whenever I feel like it, as I purchased a license, and cannot externally download from my steamlibrary, similarly to GOG, giving me Anytime Access to a license of an IP that I _PURCHASED_ and _OWN_.

Valve owns many things currently that they could be using to change the face of gaming, and they intentionally refuse to acknowledge that anything is right, wrong, or otherwise.

The current bot problem across games, not to mention other IP's from other companies encouraging equally negative behaviour for the platform, as well as the lack of communications from Valve have left Us, The UserBase of Steam, no choice but to collaborate to find a solution.  I have a proposal that I will list as "Proposal 1: The OpenForum", and anyone else is welcome to submit ideas, or add to / edit a document, given that the submission is not a complete troll.  Standard Github rules apply here.  Act the fool and you will be removed, but lets hope nothing lioke that has to happen.

# What can I do while a proposal is worked out?

Do me a favor.  Install banana, go ham, we will all as one unit dilute the market.  If you profit from it, thats your choice.  But we will take the latest edition of this issue of Valve having Profiteering as their agenda, and make a mess out of it.

O7 good luck soldiers, The Team, The Community, and Steam itself, rests on us, and our actions (allegedly).
